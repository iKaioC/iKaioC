## 👋 Hello

I'm **Kaio Conde**, a **software developer with nearly 10 years of experience**, strongly focused on **backend development**, while maintaining solid expertise in **front-end technologies**.

Throughout my career, I've worked on a wide range of web projects — from small systems to complex, scalable applications — always prioritizing **clean code**, **performance**, and **maintainability**.

My core expertise is **PHP and its ecosystem**, but I’m comfortable working across the stack whenever the project requires it.
